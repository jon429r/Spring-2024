Exploration: 3.4.3 (p.117)

As will be seen in Part V, the nxn matrix

A = [-2 1               ]
    [  1 -2 1           ]
    [      1 -2 1       ]
    [        1 -2 1     ]
    [          1 -2 1   ]
    [            1 -2 1 ]
    [               1 -2]

is particularly useful when solving differential equations. Form this matrix for values of n ranging over several orders of magnitude (for example, powers of 2 or 10)
and compute K_2(A) for each. Plot K_2(A) versus n, using logarithmic scales on both axes.

Concept Check 3.4.4 (p.119)

1. What is the condition number of a square nonsingular matrix A, and what is the significance for solving Ax = b?

Solution: The condtion number is measures the sensitivity of a matrix to small changes in input data. The equation for the condition number is: K(A) = ||A||* ||A^-1||.

2. What is a geometric interpretation of the condition number?

Solution: The geometric interpretation may be a graph which shows that a small change in input data: x shows a small change in output: y

3. Which measure is more appropriate for determining whether a matrix is nearly singular: the determinant, or the condition number?

Solution: The condition number is more appropriate, because the determinant is equal to 0 if and only if A is singular, the determinate may be very large but A
may be very singular, there is no correlation between the derminant and whether a matrix is singular unless it is singular.

4. Briefly describe, in words, the process of iterative refinement. When is it most effective?

Solution: Iterative refinement is a process of improving the accuracy of a solution by making small adjustments per iteration. The algorithm computes the residual
to update the solution with an estimate of its error.

5. What is the benefit of scaling the equations in the system Ax = b, even though it does not change the solution?

Solution: Scaling can help reduce the condition number of the matrix.

Exercise 1b (p.120)

consider the matrix A

[1 1+E]
[1-E 1]

0 < E << 1

Compute the LU decomposition of A. How small can E be for the double-precision floating-point representation of U to be singular?

Solution:

I used this julia script to calculate the threshold value of E:

```julia

using LinearAlgebra

function find_singular_threshold()
    E = floatmin(Float64)  # Start with the smallest positive normal floating-point number
    while true
        try
            # Define the matrix A with the current value of E
            A = [1 1+E; 1-E 1]

            # Compute the LU decomposition of A
            F = lu(A)

            # Extract the upper triangular matrix U
            U = F.U

            # Check if U is singular
            if det(U) == 0
                println("Threshold reached: For E = $E, U is singular.")
                return E
            end
        catch ex
            println("Error: ", ex)
            println("Threshold reached: For E = $E, U is singular.")
            return E
        end
        # Increment E and continue
        E *= 2
    end
end

# Find the singular threshold
threshold = find_singular_threshold()

```

output:
Error: SingularException(2)
Threshold reached: For E = 2.2250738585072014e-308, U is singular
