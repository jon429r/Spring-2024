1a. Use induction to verify the candidate solution to each of the 
following recurrence equations:
tn = 4_tn-1 for n>1
t_1=3

3. The number of moves (m_n for n rings) needed in the towers of hanoi 
problem is given by the following recurrence equation:
m_n = 2m_n-1 + 1 for n>1
m_n =1 
use induction to show that the solution to this recurrence equation is:
 m_n = n^n - 1

 5. The ancient greeks were very interested in the sequences resulting from
 geometric shapes such as the following triangluar numbersL
          
           0
      0    00
  0,  00,  000 ...  ->  (1,3,6,...)

  write a recurrence equation for the nth term in this sequence, guess a solution
  and use indution to verify your solution
