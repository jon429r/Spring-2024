19b

answer: N^2

20a-d.

answer a: t_n = C*4^n
answer b: 
answer c:
answer d:

21.

answer a: N^3 is a strictly increasing function becuase its derivative 
which is 3N^2 is always positive.
answer b: g (n) = 2n3 âˆ’ 6n2 is an eventually nondecreasing function becuase
its derivative is 6n^2 - 12n which is always positive for n > 2.

24a.

answer: a < b^k for all k, since 2 < 5^3. Because of the rule that T(n) = O(n^k) if a<b^k,
we can say that T(n) = O(n^3).

25a.

answer:  a>b^k , since 14 > 5^1. Because of the rule that T(n) = 0(n^log)_b(a) if a>b^k,
we can say that T(n) = O(n^log_5(14)).
