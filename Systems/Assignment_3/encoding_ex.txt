Q1: Utilize LZW compression algorithm to compress the string “EFGFGFGEF”, calculate the
compression ratio, then decompress it. Please present both the answers and the calculation
processes. It's essential to note that only the final answers will incur a deduction of half points. (20 points)

Dict: 0: E, 1: F, 2: G, 3: FG

0 3 3 3 0 1

Ratio: 9 / 6 = 1.5

Decompressed: EFGFGFGEF
