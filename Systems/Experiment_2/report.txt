Problem
In this experiment, you are asked to use Linux command lines to accomplish 3 tasks.
Task 1: Linux permissions.
Task 2: Advanced text file manipulation.
Task 3: Vi text editor.

Implementation
Provide a brief description of the commands and arguments you intend to use to complete the tasks. Especially for task 3, illustrate how you accomplished it through Vi commands.

Results
For Task1 and Task2, include all the results from each step in a single screenshot and paste it in this section. Ensure that the screenshot encompasses both the execution outcomes of every step, and the command lines you used for every step. 
For Task 3, including screenshots is not obligatory, just ensure that you clearly explain your solution in the Implementation Section.
Conclusion
Did you encounter any challenges during the execution of this experiment? If yes, state the issue and explain how to solve it. If not, elaborate on the insights gained from this experiment.
